**1. Modal and Semi-Modal Verbs**

[STUDENT]
**1. Modal & Semi-Modal Verbs:** Auxiliaries expressing possibility, necessity/obligation, permission, assumption, advice. Followed by an infinitive (no 'to'). Don't take '-s' in 3rd person singular; don't use 'do' for questions/negatives.
**Infinitive Types:**
*   **Plain:** `modal + base verb` (e.g., `She can swim.`)
*   **Continuous:** `modal + be + -ing` (e.g., `He must be working.`) - assumption about present
*   **Perfect:** `modal + have + past participle` (e.g., `She might have forgotten.`) - assumption/regret about past
*   **Perfect Continuous:** `modal + have been + -ing` (e.g., `He must have been working all night.`) - assumption about past duration
**Key Modals:**
*   **can/could:** ability, possibility, permission, request (`Could you help?`)
*   **may/might:** possibility (might = less likely), formal permission (`May I?`)
*   **must/have to:** necessity/obligation (must=internal, have to=external), strong assumption (`She must be home.`)
*   **should/ought to:** advice, expectation (`You should see a doctor.`)
*   **will/would:** future, willingness, requests, past habits (would) (`I would visit...`)
**Exercises:**
1.  Choose: You (must/might) wear a seatbelt. (Could/Must) you pass the salt? She (can't/should) be home. You (needn't be/would be) worried. It (might/would) rain.
2.  Translate: Ona musiała czekać (past assumption). Powinieneś był powiedzieć. Możliwe, że on teraz pracuje. Czy mógłbyś mi pomóc? Nie musisz przychodzić.

[SCRIPT]
Modals express shades of meaning (possibility, necessity etc.). Key rules: no '-s' (he can), no 'do' (Can you?), infinitive without 'to' (must go). Combine with different infinitives (plain, continuous, perfect, perfect continuous) for varied meanings (e.g., present assumption vs past assumption). Note subtle differences: must (internal) vs have to (external); may vs might (probability). `Would` also for past habits.

[NOTES]
*   Key difference: must (internal urge/strong belief) vs. have to (external rule/obligation).
*   Common error: `must to go`. Correction: `must go`.
*   Common error: confuse `must not` (prohibition) vs `don't have to` (no obligation).
*   `Might` expresses lower probability than `may`.

---

**2. Active and Passive Participles**

[STUDENT]
**2. Participles:** Verb forms used as adjectives or in verb phrases.
*   **Active (Present) Participle:** `verb + -ing`
    *   As adjective (active cause): `The crying baby.`, `A boring lecture.`
    *   In continuous tenses: `He was walking.`
    *   In participle clauses: `Arriving late, I missed the start.`
*   **Passive (Past) Participle:** `past participle (-ed/III form)`
    *   As adjective (passive result): `The broken window.`, `Excited fans.`
    *   In perfect tenses / passive voice: `It has been completed.`
    *   In participle clauses: `Written in 1925, the novel...`
**Key Pairs (Adjectives):**
*   (-ing: causing effect) vs (-ed: experiencing effect)
*   `boring` vs `bored`; `exciting` vs `excited`; `interesting` vs `interested`; `terrifying` vs `terrified`; `confusing` vs `confused`.
**Participle Constructions:**
*   Start of sentence: `Walking to work, I...`, `Shocked by the news, she...`
*   With perception verbs: `I saw him running.`, `They found the door locked.`
**Exercises:**
1.  Choose: The movie was (exciting/excited). Students were (tiring/tired). Instructions were (confusing/confused). He was (surprising/surprised) to win. The (exhausting/exhausted) child slept.
2.  Rewrite using participle clauses: While I was walking..., I saw... → ? Because he was exhausted, he... → ? After she finished..., she... → ?

[SCRIPT]
Participles (-ing active, -ed/-en passive) act like adjectives or form tenses. Active (-ing) describes the *cause* of a feeling/action (a *boring* film *causes* boredom). Passive (-ed) describes the *recipient* of a feeling/action (a *bored* student *experiences* boredom). This distinction is crucial for pairs like exciting/excited. Also used in clauses replacing subordinate clauses (e.g., `Walking home, I...` instead of `While I was walking...`).

[NOTES]
*   Emphasize emotion diff: boring (causes boredom) / bored (feels boredom). Exciting/excited, etc.
*   Ensure subject agreement in participle clauses (avoid dangling participles: *`Walking down the street, the sun shone.`*)
*   Common error: `breaked` instead of `broken`.

---

**3. Subjunctive Mood**

[STUDENT]
**3. Subjunctive Mood:** Expresses wishes, suggestions, demands, hypothetical situations (often formal).
*   **After certain verbs:** `verb (suggest, insist, recommend, demand, require...) + that + subject + base infinitive` (no '-s' for 3rd person sg).
    *   `He suggested that she apply.` (NOT applies)
    *   `They demanded that he be present.` (using base form 'be')
*   **After `It is + adjective`:** `It is essential/important/necessary + that + subject + base infinitive`.
    *   `It is essential that he be present.`
*   **Fixed expressions:** `Long live the King!`, `God save the Queen!`, `Be that as it may...`
*   **Vs 'Should':** Often replaced by `should + infinitive` in less formal English.
    *   Formal: `I suggest that he wait.` Less formal: `I suggest that he should wait.`
**Exercises:**
1.  Rewrite using subjunctive: The doctor advises that she (should take) ___ medicine. Prof recommends that we (should read) ___ articles. It is important that he (arrives) ___ on time. Director insisted everyone (should be) ___ present. I suggest that you (should try) ___ later.
2.  Subjunctive (T) or Not (N)? The report be submitted ___. She studies more ___. He take this ___. He stops this ___. Witness tell the truth ___.

[SCRIPT]
Subjunctive expresses non-facts (wishes, demands). Used formally after verbs like `suggest`, `demand`, `require` and phrases like `It is essential that...`. Key feature: uses the **base form** of the verb for all subjects (`I suggest he go`, NOT `goes`). Often replaced by 'should' in informal speech. Appears in fixed phrases (`Long live...!`).

[NOTES]
*   Primarily formal. Often replaced by `should` or infinitive informally.
*   Key: Base verb form (no '-s'). `I demand he leave.`
*   Common error: Adding '-s' to 3rd person sg verb.
*   Includes `If I were you...` (past subjunctive).

**4. Conditional Mood**

[STUDENT]
**4. Conditional Mood:** Expresses hypothetical situations and results using `would/could/might`.
**Aspects:**
*   **Perfective:** Completed hypothetical action (`I would have finished if...`)
*   **Continuous:** Ongoing hypothetical action (`She would be studying if...`)
*   **Non-continuous (Simple):** Hypothetical state/single action (`They would help if...`)
**Uses:**
*   **Conditional sentences:** (See section 21) `If I had money, I would travel.`
*   **Wishes:** `I wish I could swim.`
*   **Polite requests:** `Would you mind opening...?`
*   **Advice:** `If I were you, I would...`
*   **Mixed Conditionals:** Combine time references (`If I had studied (past), I would be a doctor (now).`)
**Exercises:**
1.  Complete (Conditional Mood): If I won..., I (buy) ___ a house. If she hadn't missed..., she (arrive) ___ on time. If we had more time, we (visit) ___ the museum. If it stopped raining, we (go) ___ for a walk now. If I had known..., I (bring) ___ a gift.
2.  Rewrite (Mixed Conditionals): I didn't study medicine. I'm not a doctor now. → If...? I don't speak Japanese. I didn't get the job. → If...? She didn't buy insurance. She has to pay now. → If...?

[SCRIPT]
Conditional mood (usually with `would/could/might`) describes hypothetical/unreal situations. Appears with different aspects: perfective (`would have done` - past unreal), continuous (`would be doing` - present/future unreal ongoing), simple (`would do` - present/future unreal state/action). Used heavily in conditional sentences, wishes, polite requests, and advice (`If I were you...`). Mixed conditionals combine past causes with present results or vice versa.

[NOTES]
*   Primarily uses `would`, but `could/might/should` also possible.
*   Focus on structure in different conditional types (0, 1, 2, 3, mixed).
*   Common error: Using `will` instead of `would` in hypothetical clauses.

**5. Adjectives after Verbs of Perception**

[STUDENT]
**5. Adjectives after Perception Verbs:** Use ADJECTIVES (not adverbs) after linking verbs describing senses or appearance (`look, sound, taste, smell, feel, seem, appear, get, grow, remain, turn`). The adjective describes the subject.
*   `The soup tastes delicious.` (describes soup) NOT `deliciously`.
*   `She looks tired.` (describes her) NOT `tiredly`.
*   `It feels soft.` (describes fabric) NOT `softly`.
**Adjective vs Adverb Meaning:**
*   `She looks sad.` (Describes her appearance)
*   `She looks sadly at the photo.` (Describes how she performs the action of looking)
**Exercises:**
1.  Choose adj/adv: Coffee tastes (bitter/bitterly). She spoke (angry/angrily). He looks (sad/sadly). Music sounds (beautiful/beautifully). She looked (careful/carefully) at the doc. Situation seems (hopeless/hopelessly). Silk feels (smooth/smoothly). He played piano (good/well).
2.  Correct?: Dinner smells deliciously. She feels badly. Explanation sounds logically. You look beautifully. Cheese tastes strongly.

[SCRIPT]
After linking verbs related to senses/appearance (`look, feel, smell, taste, sound, seem, appear`), use an **adjective** to describe the *subject*, not an adverb to describe the verb. `It smells good` (adjective describes 'it'). Compare with action verbs: `She sings well` (adverb describes 'sings'). Some verbs can be linking or action verbs, changing meaning: `He looked angry` (appearance) vs `He looked angrily` (how he performed the action 'look').

[NOTES]
*   These function like `be` (linking verbs).
*   Common error: Using adverbs (e.g., `It tastes *deliciously*`).
*   Distinguish: `I feel bad` (my condition) vs `I feel badly` (my sense of touch is impaired - rare). Usually `I feel bad`.

**6. Order of Adjectives in a Noun Phrase**

[STUDENT]
**6. Adjective Order:** Multiple adjectives usually follow this order: **OSASCOMP**
1.  **O**pinion: `lovely, nice`
2.  **S**ize: `large, tiny`
3.  **A**ge/Condition: `old, new`
4.  **S**hape: `round, square`
5.  **C**olor: `red, black`
6.  **O**rigin: `French, Chinese`
7.  **M**aterial: `wooden, silk`
8.  **P**urpose/Type: `sleeping (bag), writing (desk)`
*   Examples: `A beautiful old Chinese vase.` `A small round wooden table.`
*   Numbers usually come first: `Three large new chairs.` Ordinals after 'the': `The first exciting chapter.`
**Exercises:**
1.  Order adjectives: a / wooden / square / table → ? a / Italian / new / sports / red / car → ? a / metal / large / black / box → ? an / old / interesting / Chinese / small / statue → ? three / silk / beautiful / blue / scarves → ?
2.  Correct order?: a Chinese beautiful ancient vase → ? a cotton long white dress → ? a brick red big house → ? a German new expensive car → ? some Italian old fascinating books → ?

[SCRIPT]
When using multiple adjectives before a noun, follow a general order (Opinion -> Size -> Age -> Shape -> Color -> Origin -> Material -> Purpose - remember OSASCOMP). `A lovely small old round blue Polish wooden writing desk.` (Extreme example!). Usually only 2-3 adjectives are used. Violating the order sounds unnatural. Numbers first (`Three big dogs`), ordinals after 'the' (`The second big dog`).

[NOTES]
*   Order is intuitive for native speakers; crucial for fluency.
*   Limit to 2-3 adjectives usually.
*   Common errors: Color before size/age, Origin/Material misplaced.

**7. Adjectives Used as Nouns**

[STUDENT]
**7. Adjectives as Nouns:** `The + adjective` can refer to a group of people sharing that characteristic. Always PLURAL meaning.
*   `The rich get richer.` (Rich people...)
*   `The elderly need care.` (Elderly people...)
*   `The unemployed receive benefits.` (Unemployed people...)
**Common Groups:**
*   Economic: `the rich, the poor, the homeless`
*   Age: `the young, the elderly`
*   Health/Ability: `the sick, the disabled, the blind`
*   Employment: `the employed, the unemployed`
*   Nationality (some): `the French, the British` (but: `the Germans`, `the Poles` - noun form)
**Rules:**
*   Always plural verb: `The poor are...` (NOT `is`)
*   Refers to the group, not individuals (`a blind person` vs `the blind`).
**Exercises:**
1.  Rewrite using 'the + adj': Poor people struggle. → ? Elderly people share wisdom. → ? Homeless people need shelter. → ? Young people like tech. → ? Disabled people face barriers. → ?
2.  Complete ('the + adj' + verb): homeless / need → The homeless ___ shelter. rich / have → The rich ___ responsibility. unemployed / face → The unemployed ___ challenges. young / prefer → The young often ___ music. blind / use → The blind sometimes ___ dogs.

[SCRIPT]
Use `the + adjective` to talk about groups (e.g., `the poor`, `the elderly`, `the disabled`). Always takes a plural verb (`The rich are...`). Refers to the group generally, not specific individuals. Common for social/economic/age groups. Note some nationalities work (`the French`), others need noun form (`the Germans`).

[NOTES]
*   Crucial: PLURAL VERB. `The homeless need...`
*   Doesn't work for all adjectives (esp. temporary states).
*   Common error: Using singular verb.

**8. Adverbs with Two Different Forms**

[STUDENT]
**8. Adverbs with Two Forms:** Some words have two adverb forms with different meanings (one often same as adjective, one ends in -ly).
*   **hard** (diligently) vs **hardly** (scarcely, almost not): `She works hard.` vs `She hardly works.`
*   **late** (after scheduled time) vs **lately** (recently): `He arrived late.` vs `I haven't seen him lately.`
*   **deep** (physical depth) vs **deeply** (profoundly): `Dig deep.` vs `I was deeply affected.`
*   **high** (physical height) vs **highly** (very much, greatly): `Fly high.` vs `highly respected.`
*   **near** (close in distance) vs **nearly** (almost): `Sit near me.` vs `I nearly fell.`
*   **free** (without cost) vs **freely** (without restriction): `Travel free.` vs `Speak freely.`
*   **wide** (physical width) vs **widely** (commonly): `Open wide.` vs `widely known.`
*   **short** (abruptly) vs **shortly** (soon): `Stop short.` vs `arrive shortly.`
**Exercises:**
1.  Choose form: Thinking (deep/deeply). He (hard/hardly) knew anyone. Children are (wide/widely) awake. Stopped (short/shortly) before the top. Speaks English (pretty/prettily) well. Disease is (wide/widely) spread. Arrived (late/lately). Haven't been to cinema (late/lately).
2.  Translate: On ciężko pracuje. Ona prawie nie je mięsa. Ostatnio dużo podróżuję. Książka jest powszechnie uważana... Dzieci wchodzą bezpłatnie.

[SCRIPT]
Key pairs: `hard` (work hard) vs `hardly` (almost not); `late` (arrive late) vs `lately` (recently). Often, the form without '-ly' is more literal/physical (`fly high`), while the '-ly' form is more figurative/emphatic (`highly recommended`). Using the wrong one changes meaning significantly.

[NOTES]
*   Difference is meaning, not style.
*   `Hardly` has a negative meaning.
*   Common errors: Confusing hard/hardly, late/lately.

---

**9. Reflexive and Emphatic Pronouns**

[STUDENT]
**9. Reflexive & Emphatic Pronouns:** Forms: `myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, themselves`.
*   **Reflexive:** Object is the same as the subject (action reflects back). Essential for meaning.
    *   `She cut herself.`
    *   `I taught myself.`
    *   `Look at yourself.`
    *   Idioms: `Help yourself.`, `Behave yourself.`
*   **Emphatic:** Emphasizes the subject or object ('sam/sama'). Can be removed without changing basic meaning.
    *   `I myself don't believe it.` (emphasizes 'I')
    *   `The president himself attended.` (emphasizes 'president')
    *   `They fixed it themselves.` (emphasizes 'they' did it, not someone else)
**Exercises:**
1.  Reflexive (R) or Emphatic (E)? She made it herself ___. We enjoyed ourselves ___. Manager himself called ___. Children taught themselves ___. I myself disagree ___. They hurt themselves ___.
2.  Complete: President ___ attended. Don't cut ___. Students prepared ___. We built this ___. I'll treat ___ tonight. She saw ___ in mirror. Children behaved ___ well. He repaired car ___.

[SCRIPT]
Reflexive pronouns (`myself`, `yourself` etc.) are used when subject and object are the same (`He cut himself`). They are essential to the meaning. Emphatic pronouns use the same forms but just add emphasis (`I did it myself` = I did it, not someone else). Emphatic pronouns can be removed without losing the core meaning.

[NOTES]
*   Key difference: Essential (reflexive) vs Emphasis (emphatic).
*   Common error: `*He told myself.` → `He told me.`
*   Common error: `*He enjoyed.` → `He enjoyed himself.` (if the enjoyment was the focus).

*(Sections 10-17 would follow similar compression principles)*

**18. Reported Speech**

[STUDENT]
**18. Reported Speech:** Reporting what someone said without direct quotes. Requires changes:
*   **Pronouns:** Adjust to reporter's perspective (`I` → `he/she`).
*   **Tense Backshift:** Generally move one tense back (Present → Past, Past → Past Perfect, will → would, can → could). No backshift if reporting current truths/general facts.
*   **Time/Place expressions:** `now → then`, `here → there`, `today → that day`, `tomorrow → the next day`, `yesterday → the day before`, `ago → before`.
*   **Questions:** Change to statement word order (no inversion). Use `if/whether` for yes/no questions. `He asked where I lived.` `She asked if I was ready.`
*   **Commands/Requests:** Use `told/asked + object + to + infinitive`. `He told me to close the door.`
*   **Suggestions:** Use `suggested + gerund (-ing)`. `He suggested going.`
**Examples:**
*   Direct: `She said, "I am tired."` → Reported: `She said (that) she was tired.`
*   Direct: `He asked, "What time is it?"` → Reported: `He asked what time it was.`
**Exercises:**
1.  Report: She said, "I am studying." → ? He asked, "Where do you live?" → ? "Don't touch!" she warned. → ? "I'll call tomorrow," she promised. → ? They said, "We have seen this." → ?
2.  Direct Speech: He told me he was ill. → ? She asked if I could help. → ? Teacher advised us to practice. → ? Tom said he had been to Paris. → ? Friend suggested going to the beach. → ?

[SCRIPT]
Reported speech relays words indirectly. Main changes: pronouns shift perspective, tenses usually shift back (present->past, past->past perfect), time/place words adjust (`here`->`there`, `tomorrow`->`the next day`). Questions lose inversion (`He asked where I lived`). Commands use `told/asked + to-infinitive`. Suggestions often use `suggested + -ing`. `That` is often optional. Backshift may not apply for timeless truths.

[NOTES]
*   Focus on consistent backshift and pronoun/time/place changes.
*   Common error: Forgetting backshift.
*   Common error: Keeping question word order (`*He asked where did I live.`).
*   Common error: `*He said me.` → `He told me.` or `He said to me.`

---

**19. Compound Sentences**

[STUDENT]
**19. Compound Sentences:** Two or more independent clauses (can stand alone) joined by:
*   **Coordinating Conjunctions (FANBOYS):** `for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so`. Use a comma before the conjunction (unless clauses are very short).
    *   `She studied hard, and she passed.` `He wanted to go, but it was late.` `It rained, so we stayed in.` `He didn't call, nor did he write.` (Note inversion after 'nor')
*   **Semicolon (;):** Joins closely related independent clauses without a conjunction.
    *   `She studied hard; she passed.`
*   **Semicolon + Conjunctive Adverb + Comma:** `however, therefore, consequently, nevertheless, moreover`.
    *   `She studied hard; consequently, she passed.` `It was expensive; however, the food was good.`
**Exercises:**
1.  Join with FANBOYS: She was tired. She went to bed. → ? He wants a car. He has no money. → ? Take the bus. Walk. → ? It rained. We stayed indoors. → ? He didn't attend. He didn't send apology. → ?
2.  Join with semicolon + conjunctive adverb: Movie was boring. We left early. → ? Restaurant is expensive. Food is excellent. → ? She studied medicine. She became doctor. → ? He fears flying. He travels by train. → ? Weather was bad. Event was success. → ?

[SCRIPT]
Compound sentences link 2+ independent clauses. Use coordinating conjunctions (FANBOYS: For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So) with a comma. Or use a semicolon (;) for closely related clauses. Or use semicolon + conjunctive adverb (however, therefore) + comma. Note inversion required after `nor`. Avoid comma splice (joining independent clauses with only a comma).

[NOTES]
*   FANBOYS connect equal clauses.
*   Semicolon shows close relationship.
*   Conjunctive adverbs show logical link (contrast, result...).
*   Common error: Comma splice (`*She studied hard, she passed.`). Needs `and` or `;`.
*   Common error: Missing comma after conjunctive adverb.

---

**20. Complex Sentences**

[STUDENT]
**20. Complex Sentences:** One independent (main) clause + one or more dependent (subordinate) clauses. Dependent clauses cannot stand alone.
**Types of Dependent Clauses:**
*   **Noun Clauses:** Function as noun (Subject, Object, Predicate Nominative). Start with `that, what, whether, if, who, why, etc.`
    *   Subject: `What he said was true.`
    *   Object: `I know that he is right.` `She asked if I was ready.`
    *   Predicate Nom: `The problem is that we have no time.`
*   **Adjective (Relative) Clauses:** Modify nouns/pronouns. Start with `who, whom, whose, which, that, when, where, why`.
    *   **Defining (Restrictive):** Essential info, no commas. `The man who lives next door is friendly.` (`that` possible for people/things).
    *   **Non-defining (Non-restrictive):** Extra info, use commas. `My brother, who lives in London, is visiting.` (`that` not used).
*   **Adverbial Clauses:** Modify verbs, adjectives, adverbs. Show time, place, cause, purpose, result, condition, concession, manner, comparison. Start with conjunctions like `when, while, because, since, although, if, unless, so that, as, where`.
    *   Time: `Call me when you arrive.`
    *   Cause: `I left because I was tired.`
    *   Concession: `Although it was raining, we went out.`
    *   Purpose: `He studies so that he can pass.`
    *   Condition: `If you heat ice, it melts.`
**Exercises:**
1.  Identify clause type: Reason why he left... ? She asked if I could help... ? Book that I bought... ? When rain stops... ? Happy wherever you are... ?
2.  Join pairs (clause type): He was late. Bus broke down (cause). → ? She studied hard. Wanted to pass (purpose). → ? Movie boring. Left early (result). → ? Restaurant expensive. Go rarely (concession). → ? Call me. Arrive airport (time). → ?
3.  Complete (clause type): (Subject) ___ surprised everyone. (Object) He insisted that ___. (Adj-defining) Woman ___ is my mother. (Adj-non-defining) Paris, ___, is capital. (Adverb-purpose) Saving money so that ___.

[SCRIPT]
Complex sentences: main clause + dependent clause(s). Dependent clauses act as nouns, adjectives, or adverbs. Noun clauses (starting `that, what, whether...`) are subjects/objects. Adjective clauses (starting `who, which, that...`) modify nouns; defining (no commas, essential info) vs non-defining (commas, extra info). Adverb clauses (starting `when, because, although, if...`) modify verbs/clauses, showing time, reason, condition etc.

[NOTES]
*   Focus on punctuation: commas for non-defining adjective clauses, variable for adverb clauses.
*   `That` vs `which/who`: `that` mainly in defining; `which/who` in both (but only `which/who` in non-defining).
*   Common error: Comma use with relative clauses.
*   Common error: Using subject pronoun in adjective clause (`*The man who he lives...*`).

---

**21. Conditional Sentences**

[STUDENT]
**21. Conditional Sentences:** Express conditions and results.
*   **Zero:** General truths/facts. `If + Present Simple, Present Simple`. (`If you heat ice, it melts.`)
*   **First:** Real future possibility. `If + Present Simple, will/can/may + infinitive`. (`If it rains, we will stay home.`)
*   **Second:** Unreal/hypothetical present/future. `If + Past Simple, would/could/might + infinitive`. (`If I knew, I would tell you.`) Use `were` for all persons (formal).
*   **Third:** Unreal/hypothetical past. `If + Past Perfect, would/could/might + have + past participle`. (`If I had known, I would have helped.`)
*   **Mixed:** Combine time references.
    *   Past → Present: `If + Past Perfect, would + infinitive`. (`If I had won (past), I would be rich (now).`)
    *   Present → Past: `If + Past Simple, would + have + pp`. (`If I were rich (now), I would have bought it (past).`)
*   **Inversion (Formal):** Replace 'if'.
    *   `Had I known...` (= If I had known...)
    *   `Were I you...` (= If I were you...)
    *   `Should you need...` (= If you should need...)
**Exercises:**
1.  Identify type: If I win, I will buy... ? If I had seen, I would have said... ? Water freezes if... ? If I were rich, I would travel... ? If I had studied, I would have better job now... ?
2.  Complete: If it (rain) tomorrow, we (cancel)...? If I (be) you, I (not worry)...? If you (tell) me earlier, I (help)...? Ice (melt) if you (heat)...? If I (know), I (tell)...?
3.  Rewrite (Mixed): Didn't study medicine. Not doctor now. → ? Don't speak Japanese. Didn't get job. → ? Didn't buy insurance. Must pay now. → ?
4.  Rewrite (Inversion): If I had known... → ? If you should need... → ? If I were in your position... → ?

[SCRIPT]
Conditionals link condition (if-clause) and result. Zero (if+pres, pres) = facts. First (if+pres, will+inf) = real future possibility. Second (if+past, would+inf) = unreal present/future. Third (if+past perf, would have+pp) = unreal past. Use `were` for all persons in second conditional (formal). Mixed conditionals link different times (past cause -> present result, etc.). Formal inversion replaces 'if' (`Had I known...`).

[NOTES]
*   Key: Match clause tenses correctly for each type.
*   Common error: `will` in `if`-clause (`*If it will rain...`).
*   Common error: `would` in `if`-clause (`*If I would know...`).
*   'Unreal past' (Past Simple in 2nd cond.) refers to unreal present/future.

**22. Wishes, Preferences, Suppositions**

[STUDENT]
**22. Wishes, Preferences, Suppositions:** Expressing non-real situations. Use past tenses for unreality.
*   **Wishes (`wish`/`if only`):**
    *   Present unreal: `+ Past Simple` (`I wish I knew...`)
    *   Past unreal (regret): `+ Past Perfect` (`I wish I had gone...`)
    *   Future change/irritation: `+ would + infinitive` (`I wish it would stop raining.`)
*   **Preferences (`'d rather`/`'d sooner`):**
    *   Own action: `+ infinitive` (`I'd rather stay.`)
    *   Other's action: `+ Past Simple` (`I'd rather you left.`)
*   **Advice (`'d better`):** `+ infinitive` (no 'to') (`You'd better hurry.`)
*   **Suppositions (`suppose`/`supposing`):** `+ Past Simple` (present/future unreal) / `+ Past Perfect` (past unreal) (`Suppose you won...?`)
*   **Unreal Comparisons (`as if`/`as though`):** `+ Past Simple` (present unreal) / `+ Past Perfect` (past unreal) (`He talks as if he knew...`)
*   **`It's (high) time`:** `+ Past Simple` (`It's time we went.`)
**Exercises:**
1.  Complete: I wish I (know). She wishes she (not/spend). If only it (stop) raining! He talks as if he (be) expert. I'd rather you (not/tell). It's high time you (start).
2.  Rewrite: I don't know how to swim (wish) → ? Didn't study hard (wish) → ? Prefer stay home than go party ('d rather) → ? Should take medicine now ('d better) → ? Speaks as if native speaker (as though) → ?
3.  Time ref (Pres/Past/Fut)? I wish I were taller. __ She wishes had accepted. __ If only would stop! __ 'd rather you came tomorrow. __ It's time we left. __

[SCRIPT]
Express wishes, preferences, suppositions about unreal situations using past tenses. `Wish/If only` + Past Simple (present unreal), + Past Perfect (past regret), + `would` (future change/complaint). `'d rather/sooner` + infinitive (own action), + Past Simple (other's action). `'d better` + infinitive (advice). `Suppose/as if/it's time` + Past Simple/Perfect depending on time reference. Past tenses signal unreality, not past time.

[NOTES]
*   Key: Past tenses signal unreality.
*   `wish + would`: DON'T use for wishing about oneself (`*I wish I would...`). Use for others' actions/events.
*   Common error: Using present tense after `wish`, `as if`, `it's time`.
*   Common error: `*You better to go.` → `You'd better go.`

**23. Infinitive, Participial, and Gerundial Constructions**

[STUDENT]
**23. Verb Patterns (Inf/Gerund):** Using non-finite verbs (-ing/to+verb). Pattern depends on the main verb.
*   **Verb + to-infinitive:** `want, decide, hope, agree, plan, promise, refuse...` (`I want to go.`)
*   **Verb + gerund (-ing):** `enjoy, avoid, finish, consider, suggest, mind, miss...` (`I enjoy swimming.`)
*   **Verb + Object + to-infinitive:** `want, ask, tell, expect, allow, persuade...` (`I want you to stay.`)
*   **Verb + Object + bare infinitive (no 'to'):** Verbs of perception (`see, hear, watch`) + `make, let, help`. (`I saw him leave.`, `She made them wait.`)
*   **Verb + Object + present participle (-ing):** Perception verbs (emphasizes duration). `find, catch, leave`. (`I saw him leaving.`, `She caught them cheating.`)
*   **Verb + Object + past participle:** Causatives (`have, get`) or verbs like `want, need`. (`I got my car repaired.`, `I want this done.`)
*   **Verbs with Meaning Change:**
    *   `remember/forget to do` (future action) vs `remember/forget doing` (past action)
    *   `stop to do` (pause for another action) vs `stop doing` (quit)
    *   `try to do` (attempt) vs `try doing` (experiment)
    *   `regret to inform` (formal bad news) vs `regret doing` (repent past action)
**Exercises:**
1.  Choose: enjoy (swim)?; promise (help)?; avoid (use)?; remember (lock - this morning)?; forget (bring - passport)?; stop (get - coffee)?; try (add - salt)?; regret (inform - application rejected)?
2.  Complete: heard doorbell (ring)? had hair (cut)? caught them (cheat)? parents want me (study)? teacher made us (wait)? saw her (cross)? let me (borrow)? found him (sleep)?

[SCRIPT]
Many verbs are followed by `to-infinitive` (`want to go`) or `gerund` (`enjoy swimming`). Some take object + infinitive (`ask him to leave`). Perception verbs (`see, hear`) and `make/let` take object + *bare* infinitive (`saw him leave`). Perception verbs can also take object + `-ing` (for duration: `saw him leaving`). Causatives use object + past participle (`had it fixed`). Crucially, some verbs (`remember, forget, stop, try, regret`) change meaning depending on whether they take `to-infinitive` or `gerund`.

[NOTES]
*   Lists of verbs followed by Gerund vs Infinitive need memorization/practice.
*   Focus on verbs with meaning change (remember, stop, try...).
*   Common error: `*enjoy to swim`, `*avoid to use`.
*   Common error: `*made him to wait`, `*let me to go`.

**24. Causatives: have/get sth done, have sb do, get sb to do**

[STUDENT]
**24. Causatives:** Used when someone arranges for another person to do something.
*   **`have sth done`:** Arrange for a service (formal). `I had my car repaired.` (Someone else repaired it).
*   **`get sth done`:** Arrange for a service (less formal, implies effort). `I need to get my watch fixed.`
*   **`have sb do sth`:** Instruct/ask someone (often implies authority). Uses **bare infinitive**. `I had my assistant call him.`
*   **`get sb to do sth`:** Persuade/convince someone. Uses **to-infinitive**. `I got my friend to help me.`
*   **Tenses:** Can be used in all tenses (`I have my hair cut`, `I had it cut`, `I will have it cut`, `I have had it cut`).
*   **Negative Experience:** Can describe something unwanted happening to you. `She had her purse stolen.`
**Exercises:**
1.  Rewrite using causatives: Mechanic services my car. → I ___. Hairdresser cuts my hair. → I ___. Someone stole her wallet. → She ___. Persuaded brother to help. → I ___. Dentist checked teeth. → I ___. Asked assistant send email. → She ___. Convinced friend look after dog. → They ___. Painter painting house now. → We ___.
2.  Choose: Need to ___ before party (have my hair cut / have hairdresser cut my hair). Couldn't ___ importance (have him understand / get him to understand). They ___ while on vacation (had house robbed / had somebody rob house). He ___ documents (had secretary send / got secretary to send). We ___ last week (had living room decorated / had decorator decorate). Tried to ___ but refused (have friend help / get friend to help).

[SCRIPT]
Causatives show you arrange for someone else to do a task. `have/get something done` means someone does a service *for* you (object + past participle). `get` is more informal. `have somebody do something` (bare infinitive) means you instruct someone. `get somebody to do something` (to-infinitive) means you persuade someone. Also used for negative experiences (`had my wallet stolen`).

[NOTES]
*   Distinguish passive `have sth done` from active `have sb do sth`.
*   `have sb do` (bare inf.) vs `get sb to do` (to-inf.).
*   Common error: `*I had him to clean.` → `I had him clean.`
*   Common error: Confusing causative `I had my car fixed.` with Perfect tense `I had fixed my car.`

**25. Stylistic Inversion and Other Emphatic Forms**

[STUDENT]
**25. Inversion & Emphatics:** Used for emphasis or formal style.
*   **Inversion after Negative/Limiting Adverbs:** Use question word order (auxiliary + subject + main verb). `Never/Rarely/Seldom/Hardly/Only then/Not until...`
    *   `Seldom do I see...` (Instead of: I seldom see...)
    *   `Hardly had we arrived when...`
    *   `Only then did she realize...`
*   **Inversion after Place Expressions:** Verb before subject (often no auxiliary needed). `Here/There/Up/Down...`
    *   `Here comes the bus.`
    *   `Down came the rain.`
*   **Cleft Sentences (Emphasis):**
    *   `It + be + emphasized part + that/who...` (`It was John who called.`)
    *   `What + subject + verb + be + emphasized part.` (`What I need is help.`)
*   **Emphatic `do/does/did`:** Adds emphasis to affirmative verbs.
    *   `I do hope you can come.` `She does work hard.`
*   **Other Emphatics:** `the very same`, `that particular`, `with my own eyes`, `...the one who...`, `...himself/herself...`
**Exercises:**
1.  Rewrite with Inversion: Never seen such sunset. → ? Rarely goes theater. → ? Hardly finished when guests arrived. → ? Only after reading document understand. → ?
2.  Rewrite with Clefts: John told news yesterday (emphasize John). → ? Like his honesty most (what...). → ? Missed train because overslept (emphasize reason). → ? Met in Paris last summer (emphasize place). → ? Her smile attracted me (what...). → ?
3.  Complete (Emphatics): I told you I'd help, and I ___ intend... Although seems lazy, he ___ work hard... ___ was after finishing... ___ I need now is tea... Saw it with my ___ eyes...

[SCRIPT]
Inversion (verb before subject) adds emphasis, common in formal/literary style. Use after negative/limiting adverbs (`Never have I seen...`, `Only then did I...` - requires auxiliary verb). Use after place expressions (`Here comes...`, `Down went...` - often no auxiliary). Cleft sentences (`It was X that...`, `What I need is Y...`) focus on specific parts. Emphatic `do/does/did` stresses verbs (`I *do* agree`).

[NOTES]
*   Mainly formal/literary, except `Here/There comes...` and `So/Neither do I`.
*   Key: Use auxiliary verb in question order after negatives.
*   Common error: Forgetting auxiliary (`*Never I have seen...`).
*   Common error: Incorrect word order in clefts.
